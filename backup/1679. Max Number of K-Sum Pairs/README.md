# 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

## Problem statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

 

### Example 1
```plain
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
```

### Example 2
```plain
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
``` 

### Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.
* `1 <= k <= 10^9`.

## Solution: Count the appearances

You can use a map to count the appearances of the elements of `nums`.

### Example 2
For `nums = [3,1,3,4,3]` and `k = 6`:

* Initialize `count = 0`.
* For `i = 0`: `m[3] = 1`; `k - 3 = 3` but `m[3]` is only `1`, not enough to have two numbers.
* For `i = 1`: `m[1] = 1`; `k - 1 = 5` and `m[5] = 0`.
* For `i = 2`: `m[3] = 2`; `k - 3 = 3` and `m[3] = 2` just enough to have two numbers to perform the sum. `count = 1`. Erase those two values `3`'s from the map: `m[3] = 0`.
* For `i = 3`: `m[4] = 1`; `k - 4 = 2` and `m[2] = 0`.
* For `i = 4`: `m[3] = 1`; `k - 3 = 3` but `m[3]` is only `1`, not enough to have two numbers.
* Final `count = 1`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;
int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_map<int,int> m;
    int count = 0;
    for (int a : nums) {
        m[a]++;
        if (m[k - a] > 0) {
            if (a != k - a || m[a] >= 2) {
                count++;
                m[a]--;
                m[k - a]--;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
int main() {
    vector<int> nums{1,2,3,4};
    cout << maxOperations(nums, 5) << endl;
    nums = {3,1,3,4,3};
    cout << maxOperations(nums, 6) << endl;
}
```
```plain
Output:
2
1
```

### Complexity
* Runtime: `O(N)`, where `N = nums.length`.
* Extra space: `O(N)`.
