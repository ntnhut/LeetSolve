Sorting
===================

The arrangement of the elements in an array can hold the key to improved efficiency and a deeper understanding of your code, which is explored in this chapter as it delves into the usage of sorting algorithms.

Sorting is similar to putting puzzle pieces to reveal the overall structure. Rearranging elements makes it possible to retrieve data more quickly, conduct searches more quickly, and even discover patterns and linkages that might otherwise go unnoticed.

What this chapter covers:

1. **Introduction to Sorting:** Establish a strong foundation by understanding the significance of sorting, its impact on algorithmic performance, and the role of ordering in data analysis.

2. **Stability and Uniqueness:** Learn about the concepts of stability and uniqueness in sorting and how they can impact the integrity and usefulness of sorted data.

3. **Insights through Sorting:** Discover scenarios where sorted data provides valuable insights, such as identifying trends, anomalies, or patterns that inform decision-making.
