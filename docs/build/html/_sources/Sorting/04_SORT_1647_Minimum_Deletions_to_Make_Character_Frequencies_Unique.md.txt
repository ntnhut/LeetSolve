# Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique

## [Problem statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/)

A string `s` is called good if there are no two different characters in `s` that have the same frequency.

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make `s` good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string `"aab"`, the frequency of `'a'` is `2`, while the frequency of `'b'` is `1`.

### Example 1
```text
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already good.
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way is to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
``` 

### Constraints

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution: Delete the frequencies in sorted order
Your goal is to make all the frequencies be different.

One way of doing that is sorting the frequencies and performing the deletion.

### Example 4
For `s = "ceaacbb"`, the frequencies of the characters are: `freq['a'] = 2, freq['b'] = 2, freq['c'] = 2` and `freq['e'] = 1`. They are already in sorted order.

* Let the current frequency be the first frequency `freq['a'] = 2`.
* The next frequency is `freq['b'] = 2`, equal to the current frequency. Delete one appearance to make the current frequency be `1`.
* The next frequency is `freq['c'] = 2`, bigger than the current frequency. Delete two appearances to make the current frequency to be `0`.
* Because the current frequency is `0`, delete all appearances of the remaining frequencies, which is `freq['e'] = 1`.
* In total there are `4` deletions.

### Code
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int minDeletions(string s) {
    vector<int> freq(26, 0);
    for (char& c: s) {
        freq[c - 'a']++;
    }
    sort(freq.begin(), freq.end(), greater<int>());
    int deletion = 0;
    int currentFreq = freq[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < freq.size() && freq[i] > 0; i++) {
        if (currentFreq == 0) {
            deletion += freq[i];
        } else if (freq[i] >= currentFreq) {
            deletion += freq[i] - currentFreq + 1;
            currentFreq--;
        } else {
            currentFreq = freq[i];
        }
    }
    return deletion;
}
int main() {
    cout << minDeletions("aab") << endl;
    cout << minDeletions("aaabbbcc") << endl;
    cout << minDeletions("ceabaacb") << endl;
}
```
```text
Output:
0
2
2
```

### Complexity
* Runtime: `O(N)`, where `N = s.length`;
* Extra space: `O(1)` since `26` is not a big number.
