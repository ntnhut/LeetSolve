## A brief about {index}`algorithm complexity`

**Algorithm complexity**, also known as **runtime complexity**, is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. It is an essential concept in computer science, as it helps programmers evaluate and optimize their algorithms' performance.

The complexity of an algorithm is usually measured in terms of its **Big O notation**, which describes the upper bound of the algorithm's running time as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(n)` will have a running time proportional to the input size. In contrast, an algorithm with a time complexity of `O(n^2)` will have a running time proportional to the square of the input size.

Algorithm complexity is important because it helps programmers determine their algorithms' **efficiency** and **scalability**. In general, algorithms with lower complexity are more efficient, as they require less time and resources to process larger inputs. By analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm, programmers can identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize their code accordingly.

In addition to time complexity, algorithms may also have **space complexity**, which measures the **memory** required to execute the algorithm. Space complexity is also measured in Big O notation and is important for optimizing the memory usage of an algorithm.

While it is important to optimize the performance of algorithms, it is also important to balance this with **readability** and **maintainability**. A highly optimized algorithm may be difficult to understand and maintain, which can lead to problems in the long run. Therefore, it is important to balance performance and readability when designing and implementing algorithms.

In summary, algorithm complexity is an essential concept in computer science that helps programmers evaluate and optimize their algorithms' performance. By analyzing an algorithm's time and space complexity, programmers can identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize their code to improve efficiency and scalability.


## Why {index}`readable code`?

**Readable code** is code that is **easy to understand**, **maintain**, and **modify**. It is an essential aspect of programming, as it ensures that code is accessible to other programmers and helps to prevent errors and bugs. Readable code is important for several reasons.

Firstly, readable code makes it easier for other programmers to **understand and modify** it. This is particularly important in collaborative projects where multiple programmers work on the same codebase. If the code is not readable, it can lead to confusion and errors, making it difficult for others to work on it.

Secondly, readable code helps to **prevent bugs and errors**. When code is easy to understand, it is easier to identify and fix potential issues before they become problems. This is important for ensuring the code is reliable and performs as expected.

Thirdly, readable code can **improve the overall quality** of the codebase. When code is easy to understand, it is easier to identify areas for improvement and make changes to improve the code. This can help improve the codebase's efficiency and maintainability, leading to a better overall product.

Finally, readable code can **save time and money**. When code is easy to understand, it is easier to maintain and modify. This can help reduce the time and resources required to make changes to the codebase, leading to cost savings in the long run.

In conclusion, readable code is an essential aspect of programming that ensures that code is accessible, error-free, and efficient. By focusing on readability when designing and implementing code, programmers can improve the quality and reliability of their code, leading to a better overall product.
