# Preface

Welcome to *The Problem Solver's Guide To Coding*, a comprehensive journey to master problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques using C++. This book results from my experiences, challenges, failures and successes in my programming career. 

One of the most critical phases in software developer hiring process is the **coding interview**, a rigorous process where candidates are tested on their problem-solving skills and technical proficiency. Companies like FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) often subject candidates to three to four rounds of interviews, making preparation essential for success.

My journey with coding interviews began during a pivotal career change in the summer of 2021. During this transitional period, I discovered LeetCode, a platform that soon became my daily companion in honing my programming skills. What started as a means to practice new languages (Golang and C#) quickly evolved into a deep exploration of my strongest language, C++.

One day, I decided to write an article for each challenge and share it on my blog leetsolve.com. Over time, my daily practice transformed into more than 70 challenges, each accompanied by a detailed article encompassing problem statements, various approaches, C++ code implementations, thorough explanations, and complexity analyses.

As I delved into these coding challenges, I realized their potential to empower aspiring programmers, students, and junior developers **to excel in interviews and master problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**.

### The book's overview

*The Problem Solver's Guide to Coding* presents challenges covering **fundamental** data structures, algorithms, and mathematical problems. Challenges are grouped in topics, starting with the simplest data structure - Array. Most are arranged in order of increasing difficulty, but you can pick any chapter or any challenge to start since I write each independently to the other. 

Challenges in this book are curated from LeetCode.com, focusing on those that are **not difficult** but provide valuable learning experiences. You might encounter some simple challenges I go directly to the code without saying much about the idea (intuition) since their solution is straightforward. 

I also keep the problems' original constraints (inputs' size, limits, etc.) as the code in this book is the ones I submitted on Leetcode.com. It explains why I usually focus on the core algorithm and do not consider/handle corner cases or invalid inputs.

The problems in each chapter comes with a detailed solution, explaining the logic behind the solution and how to implement it in C++, my strongest programming language. 

At the end of some problems, I also provide similar problems on leetcode.com for you to solve on your own, as practicing is essential for reinforcing understanding and mastery of the concepts presented in the book. By engaging in problem-solving exercises, you can apply what you have learned, develop your problem-solving skills, and gain confidence in your ability to tackle real-world challenges.

In this book, I focus on readable code rather than optimal one, as most of you are at the beginner level. Some of my solutions might need to be in better runtime or memory. But I keep my code in my style or coding convention, where readability is vital.

Moreover, my weekly sharing of articles with various developer communities has refined the content and established a connection with a diverse group of programming enthusiasts.

### Who is this book for?

This book is tailored to benefit a wide audience, from **students** beginning their programming journey to **experienced developers** looking to enhance their skills. Regardless of your experience level, whether you're **preparing for coding interviews** or simply seeking to **improve your problem-solving abilities**, this book is designed to meet your needs.

As a minimum requirement, you are supposed to have some basic background in C++ programming language, data structures and algorithms like a second-year undergraduate in Computer Science.

What sets this book apart is its focus on practicality. The challenges presented here are not just exercises; they mirror **real coding interviews** from top companies like FAANG. 

As you work through the coding challenges in this book, you'll learn new skills, improve your problem-solving abilities, and develop your confidence as a programmer.
