# Preface

Welcome to **The Problem Solver's Guide To Coding**, a comprehensive journey to master **problem-solving**, **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **programming techniques** using **C++**. 

This book results from my experiences, challenges, and successes in the programming world. It started with a discovery during a pivotal moment in my career change in the summer of 2021.

During that transitional period, I came across **LeetCode**, a platform that became my daily companion in improving my programming skills. What began as a tool for practicing new languages, specifically Golang and C#, soon evolved into a deep exploration of my most proficient language, C++. 

Over time, my daily practice transformed into more than **70 challenges**, each accompanied by a detailed **article** encompassing **problem statements**, **various approaches**, **C++ code implementations**, **thorough explanations**, and **complexity analyses**.

As I dove into the intricacies of these coding challenges, I realized that they held the potential to be more than just individual exercises. They could be woven into a comprehensive guide that could empower **aspiring programmers**, **students**, and **junior developers** to excel in **interviews** and master the craft of **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**.

This book is not a compilation of C++ code snippets and algorithms; it's a **roadmap** designed to **elevate your programming skills**. Each chapter represents a milestone in your journey, guiding you through the complexities of data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming techniques. Whether you're a student embarking on your programming odyssey or a junior developer seeking to sharpen your skills, this book is tailored to meet your needs.

What sets this book apart is its focus on **practicality**. The challenges presented here are not just exercises; they are **real-world scenarios** that will stretch your understanding and push you to think critically. 

Moreover, my weekly sharing of articles through my blog [leetsolve.com](https://leetsolve.com) with various developer communities has refined the content and established a connection with a diverse group of programming enthusiasts.


By immersing yourself in the challenges and insights shared in this book, you will not only prepare for coding interviews but also cultivate a mindset beyond the scope of a job interview. You will become a **problem solver**, a **strategic thinker**, and a **proficient C++ programmer**.

As you embark on this journey, remember that every challenge you encounter is an opportunity for growth. Embrace the complexities, learn from each solution, and let the knowledge you gain propel you to new heights in your programming career.

Thank you for joining me on this expedition. 

**May your code be elegant, your algorithms efficient, and your programming journey genuinely transformative.**

Happy coding!
