# Preface

Welcome to *The Problem Solver's Guide To Coding*, a comprehensive journey to master problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, and programming techniques using C++. 

This book results from my experiences, challenges, failures and successes in my programming career. It started with a discovery during a pivotal moment in my career change in the summer of 2021.

During that transitional period, I came across LeetCode, a platform that became my daily companion in improving my programming skills. What began as a tool for practicing new languages, specifically Golang and C#, soon evolved into a deep exploration of my most proficient language, C++. 

Over time, my daily practice transformed into more than 70 challenges, each accompanied by a detailed article encompassing problem statements, various approaches, C++ code implementations, thorough explanations, and complexity analyses.

As I dove into the intricacies of these coding challenges, I realized that they held the potential to be more than just individual exercises. They could be woven into a comprehensive guide that could empower aspiring programmers, students, and junior developers to excel in interviews and master the craft of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## The book's overview

This book includes coding challenges that cover basic[^basic] data structures, algorithms, and mathematical problems. The topics (chapters) are put in order of difficulty, starting from the simplest data structure - Array. 

[^basic]: Such advanced topics like Tree, Graph, Back Tracking, etc. are not included in this version. 


The coding challenges in this book are picked from leetcode.com. You can find their link in the footnote. I chose the ones that are not too difficult and do not require much effort and determination to solve. You might come across some simple problems I go directly to the code without saying much about the idea (intuition) since it is straight-forward. 

I also keep the problems' original constraints (inputs' size, limits, etc.) as the code in this book is the one I submitted on Leetcode.com. It explains why I do not consider/handle corner cases or invalid inputs.

The problems in each chapter are also put in order of increasing difficulty. Each challenge comes with a detailed solution, explaining the logic behind the solution and how to implement it in C++, my strongest programming language[^python].

[^python]: As of this book is written, Python is more popular than C++. But when it comes to high-performance programming (runtime and memory), C or C++ is still the king. 

At the end of some problems, I also provide similar problems on leetcode.com for you to practice solving on your own, as practicing is essential for reinforcing understanding and mastery of the concepts presented in the book. By engaging in problem-solving exercises, you can apply what you have learned, develop your problem-solving skills, and gain confidence in your ability to tackle real-world challenges.

In this book, I focus on readable code rather than optimal one, as most of you are at the beginner level. Some of my solutions might need to be in better runtime or memory. But I keep my code in my style or coding convention, where readability is vital.

Moreover, my weekly sharing of articles through my blog [leetsolve.com](https://leetsolve.com) with various developer communities has refined the content and established a connection with a diverse group of programming enthusiasts.

## Who is this book for?

This book is not a compilation of C++ code snippets and algorithms; it's a roadmap designed to elevate your programming skills. Each chapter represents a milestone in your journey, guiding you through the complexities of data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming techniques. Whether you're a **student** embarking on your programming odyssey or a **junior developer** seeking to sharpen your skills, this book is tailored to meet your needs.

As a minimum requirement, you are supposed to have some **basic** background in C++ programming language, data structures and algorithms like a second-year undergraduate in Computer Science.

## What can you expect from this book and what not?

What sets this book apart is its focus on practicality. The challenges presented here are not just exercises; most of them are real coding interviews from FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) that will stretch your understanding and push you to think critically. 

As you work through the coding challenges in this book, you'll learn new skills, improve your problem-solving abilities, and develop your confidence as a programmer. 

- This book is not a textbook about Data Structures and Algorithms. You can read *Introduction to Algorithms*[^algo] for more in-depth about data structures, algorithms and complexity analysis.

- This book is not a complete C++ programming book. You can read *The C++ Programming Language*[^cpp] for all about C++ programming language. 

[^algo]: Introduction to Algorithms, T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and C. Stein, MIT Press.
[^cpp]: The C++ Programming Language, B. Stroustrup, Addison-Wesley.

## Acknowledgement

To my invaluable previewers, especially Phùng Phú Tài and Alexander Volkodav. Your dedication, insights, and attention to detail have shaped The Problem Solver's Guide To Coding into its final form. 

Thank you for your invaluable contributions and unwavering support.

## Summary

Students and developers! By immersing yourself in the challenges and insights shared in this book, you will not only prepare for coding interviews but also cultivate a mindset beyond the scope of a job interview. You will become a problem solver, a strategic thinker, and a proficient C++ programmer.

As you embark on this journey, remember that every challenge you encounter is an opportunity for growth. Embrace the complexities, learn from each solution, and let the knowledge you gain propel you to new heights in your programming career.

Thank you for joining me on this expedition. 

**May your code be elegant, your algorithms efficient, and your programming journey genuinely transformative.**

> *Happy coding!*
