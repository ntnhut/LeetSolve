Welcome to LeetSolve!
=====================

Hi! It's Nhut.

This docs shares my C++ solutions to selected coding challenges from LeetCode.com.

I aim to provide a resource for you - aspiring programmers, hobbyists, and professionals - to learn from my approach to these challenges and improve your problem-solving skills. 

I believe that by sharing my solutions, I can help you and those who are struggling with similar challenges and provide insights into the best practices for solving them.

My solutions are written in C++. I also provide detailed explanations of my approach to the challenges, including my thought processes and any trade-offs I considered. 

I hope this docs will serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their coding skills, learn new programming techniques, or simply enjoy the challenge of solving coding puzzles.

If you want to improve your programming skills and learn new techniques, this docs is for you! 

Feel free to share your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions. I'm always looking for ways to improve and provide better content for you. Just drop me a message at nhut@nhutnguyen.com.

Happy coding!
Nhut Nguyen, Ph.D.
