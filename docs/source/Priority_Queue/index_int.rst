Priority Queue
=========

This chapter explores **priority queues**, a fascinating data structure designed to manage elements with distinct levels of importance. In this chapter, we'll focus on harnessing the capabilities of C++'s ``std::priority_queue`` from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Think of a priority queue as a line at a theme park, where individuals with priority passes are served before others. Similarly, a priority queue ensures that elements with higher priority are processed ahead of those with lower priority, enabling us to address a wide range of problems that involve ordering and selection.

**What this chapter covers:**

1. **Understanding Priority Queues:** Begin by grasping the essence of priority queues, their underlying mechanisms, and the significance of their unique ordering.

2. **Leveraging std::priority_queue:** Dive into the versatile ``std::priority_queue`` container provided by the STL, mastering its usage for managing priorities effectively.

3. **Operations and Methods:** Explore the operations available in ``std::priority_queue``, including insertion, and extraction while maintaining optimal order.

4. **Custom Comparators:** Customize the behavior of your priority queue by utilizing custom comparators, tailoring it to handle diverse data types and priority criteria.

5. **Problem-Solving with Priority Queues:** Learn strategies for tackling problems where prioritization is key, from scheduling tasks to efficient data retrieval.
