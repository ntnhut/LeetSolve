Hash Table
==========

This chapter is about the C++ Standard Template Library's ``std::unordered_map`` and how it can help your programming. 

With hash-based data structures, you can store and retrieve information quickly, like a well-organized library. Hash tables allow you to efficiently manage data by inserting, locating, and removing elements, even from large datasets. C++'s ``std::unordered_map`` makes it easy to use hash tables without manual implementation.

What This Chapter Covers:

1. **Exploring std::unordered_map:** Dive into the C++ Standard Template Library's `std::unordered_map` container, learning how to use it effectively for mapping keys to values.

2. **Problem-Solving with Hash Tables:** Learn strategies for solving many problems using hash tables, including frequency counting, anagram detection, and more.
