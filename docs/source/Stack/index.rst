This chapter explores the **stack** data structure, a useful tool for managing data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) way. We'll investigate the basics of stacks and examine how they work using C++'s `std::stack`` and ``std::vector`` from the Standard Template Library (STL). 

Stacks in programming are like a stack of books where you add and remove books from the top. They provide a structured way to manage data, making them ideal for handling temporary information, tracking function calls, and solving various algorithmic challenges.

What this chapter covers:

1. **Introduction to Stacks:** Begin by understanding the core principles of stacks, their fundamental operations, and their real-world applications.

2. **Leveraging `std::stack`:** Dive into the STL's powerful `std::stack` container, mastering its usage and versatility for stack-based operations.

3. **Exploring `std::vector`:** Discover the capabilities of `std::vector` in context with stacks, exploiting its dynamic array nature to create flexible stack structures.

4. **Stack Operations:** Explore operations such as **push** and **pop**, understanding their impact on the stack's state and memory usage.

5. **Balancing Parentheses:** Tackle the classic problem of parentheses balancing using stacks, a prime example of their utility in parsing and validation.

As you progress through this chapter, you'll learn about the importance of stacks and how `std::stack` and `std::vector` can help you solve problems more efficiently. By the end of the chapter, you'll thoroughly understand the stack data structure's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and how you can leverage `std::stack` and `std::vector` to manage data effectively. Let's embark on this enlightening journey through stacks and uncover their potential for simplifying complex operations and algorithmic problems!
