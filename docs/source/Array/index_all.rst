In this chapter, we'll explore the basics of **arrays** - collections of elements organized in a sequence. While they may seem simple, there are many concepts and techniques you can learn from arrays to improve your coding skills. We'll cover topics like **indexing**, **iteration**, and **manipulation**, as well as dynamic arrays (``std::vector``) and time/space complexity. 

Along the way, we'll tackle challenging problems like **searching**, **sorting**, and **subarray** problems, using a structured approach to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.

What this chapter covers:

1. **Fundamentals of Arrays:** Gain a solid understanding of arrays, their properties, and how to access and manipulate elements efficiently.

2. **Array Operations:** Learn essential array operations like insertion, deletion, and updating elements, and understand their trade-offs.

3. **Dynamic Arrays:** Explore dynamic arrays, their advantages over static arrays, and the mechanics of resizing.

4. **Time and Space Complexity:** Grasp the importance of analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and how to evaluate the time and space complexity of array-related operations.

5. **Common Array Algorithms:** Discover classic algorithms such as searching, sorting, and various techniques for tackling subarray problems.

6. **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Develop systematic strategies to approach array-related challenges, including how to break down problems, devise algorithms, and validate solutions.
