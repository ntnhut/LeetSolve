# Maximum Product of Word Lengths

## [Problem statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/)

Given a string array `words`, return the maximum value of `length(word[i]) * length(word[j])` where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return `0`.

 

### Example 1
```text
Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
```

### Example 2
```text
Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
```

### Example 3
```text
Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such pair of words.
``` 

### Constraints

* `2 <= words.length <= 1000`.
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 1000`.
* `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution 1: Bruteforce

For each `words[i]`, for all `words[j]` with `j > i`, check if they do not share common letters and compute the product of their lengths.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int maxProduct(vector<string>& words) {
    int maxP = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        vector<bool> visited(26, false);
        for (char c : words[i]) {
            visited[c - 'a'] = true;
        }        
        for (int j = i + 1; j < words.size(); j++) {
            bool found = false;
            for (char c : words[j]) {              
                if (visited[c - 'a']) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) {
                maxP = max(maxP, (int) (words[i].length() * words[j].length()));
            } 
        }
    }
    return maxP;
}
int main() {
    vector<string> words{"abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"};
    cout << maxProduct(words) << endl;
    words = {"a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"};
    cout << maxProduct(words) << endl;
    words = {"a","aa","aaa","aaaa"};
    cout << maxProduct(words) << endl;
}
```
```text
Output:
16
4
0
```

### Complexity
* Runtime: `O(N^2**M)`, where `N = words.length`, `M = avg(words[i].length)`.
* Extra space: `O(1)`.

## Solution 2: Checking common letters using bit masking

You can map a `words[i]` to the bit representation of an integer `n` by their characters like the following:

* If the word `words[i]` contains the letter `'a'`, the bit at position `0` of `n` is `1`.
* If the word `words[i]` contains the letter `'b'`, the bit at position `1` of `n` is `1`.
* ...
* If the word `words[i]` contains the letter `'z'`, the bit at position `25` of `n` is `1`.

Then to check if two words have common letters, you just perform the bitwise operator AND on them.

For Example 1:

* The word `"abcw"` is mapped to `00010000000000000000000111`.
* The word `"baz"` is mapped to `10000000000000000000000011`.
* `"abcw" & "baz" = 00000000000000000000000011`. This value is not zero, which means they have common letters.

This technique is called bit masking.

### Code 
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int maxProduct(vector<string>& words) {
    int maxP = 0;
    vector<int> mask(words.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        for (char c : words[i]) {
            mask[i] |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        }        
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if ((mask[j] & mask[i]) == 0) {
                maxP = max(maxP, (int) (words[i].length() * words[j].length()));
            } 
        }
    }
    return maxP;
}
int main() {
    vector<string> words{"abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"};
    cout << maxProduct(words) << endl;
    words = {"a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"};
    cout << maxProduct(words) << endl;
    words = {"a","aa","aaa","aaaa"};
    cout << maxProduct(words) << endl;
}
```
```text
Output:
16
4
0
```

### Complexity
* Runtime: `O(N^2)`, where `N = words.length`.
* Extra space: `O(N)`.
