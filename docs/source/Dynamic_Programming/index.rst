Dynamic Programming
===================

This chapter explains **dynamic programming**, a method for solving complex problems with strategic optimization. Elegant and efficient solutions can be found by breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and using memorization and recursion. It's like solving a puzzle by solving smaller pieces and putting them together to form the larger picture.

What this chapter covers:

1. **Introduction to Dynamic Programming:** Establish a solid foundation by understanding the core principles of dynamic programming, its advantages, and the problems it best suits.

2. **Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure:** Delve into the key concepts that underlie dynamic programming, namely identifying overlapping subproblems and exploiting optimal substructure.

3. **Fibonacci Series and Beyond:** Begin with classic examples like solving the Fibonacci series and gradually progress to more intricate problems that involve complex optimization.

4. **Efficiency and Trade-offs:** Understand the trade-offs involved in dynamic programming, including the balance between time and space complexity.

5. **Problem-Solving Strategies:** Develop systematic strategies for approaching dynamic programming problems, from identifying subproblems to deriving recurrence relations.
